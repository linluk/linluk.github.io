<p><em>Due to the latest security issues at github I wanted to change my password but don’t wanted to retrain my muscle memory to remember a new password. I switched from username/password to ssh key authentication when using git via command line. This blog post is about setting up ssh keys for github.</em></p>
<h2 id="motivation-and-goal">Motivation and Goal</h2>
<p>I was lazy, too lazy to learn how to use <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH key</a> based authentication. And I was to lazy to update my muscle memory of my GitHub password every now and then. When pushed to a repository I have always entered my password manually.</p>
<p>On May 1, 2018 GitHub sent out emails to some users that their passwords may has been leaked to a small amount of GitHub employees <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-accidentally-recorded-some-plaintext-passwords-in-its-internal-logs/">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>I was not affected (at least I have not received an email) but nevertheless I wanted to change my GitHub password. I decided to learn about SSH keys and how to use it to authenticate with my GitHub account. My main goal is to have a long clumpsy unreadable but “secure” password for my GitHub account but still use my old password when using git via command line.</p>
<h2 id="lets-get-the-party-started">Let’s get the Party started</h2>
<p>At first we have to create a ssh key pair.</p>
<p>Generating a new key pair is a simple command with some options. I want to create an RSA key with 4096 Bits length. That’s what the options <code>-t rsa</code> and <code>-b 4096</code> mean. With <code>-f ~/.ssh/github_rsa</code> we specify the file where <em>ssh-keygen</em> should save the private key and with <code>-C &quot;my.email@example.com&quot;</code> I specify the email address of my GitHub account as the keys comment.</p>
<p>The command will prompt for a passphrase. <a href="http://www.useapassphrase.com/">Here</a> you can find out how to create a secure passphrase. I was lazy and just used my old GitHub password (the one I had before writing this blog post). IMHO it is secure enough because nobody should have access to my private key.</p>
<pre><code> $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;my.email@example.com.com&quot; -f ~/.ssh/github_rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/linluk/.ssh/github_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/linluk/.ssh/github_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:Fb5N1T0IKi8JGjmXKcWDAmkDhxvDfegCgkaTu86rABE my.email@example.com
The key&#39;s randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
| E = ++o o++     |
|O * o +o+oo      |
| * + +. .+ + 9   |
|* o=     o ++h   |
|o  p    S    h   |
| \ /    v  __/   |
|  v    v   //    |
|  vv  v          |
|   vvv           |
+----[SHA256]-----+</code></pre>
<p>If everything was successful you should find two new files in your <em>~/.ssh</em> directory.</p>
<pre><code> $ ls ~/.ssh/
github_rsa  github_rsa.pub</code></pre>
<p>Now we are ready to upload the newly created public key to our GitHub account. Navigate to <em>SSH and GPG keys</em> of your GitHub settings page (or use this <a href="https://github.com/settings/keys">link</a>). Here we can copy and paste the content of the file <em>github_rsa.pub</em> and give it a title. GitHub will ask us for your password.</p>
<p>Lets test the uploaded key! This is simple as trying to open a ssh session to <em>git@github.com</em> and see if it welcomes us with our GitHub user name. The command will generate a warning on first attempt wich should be no problem, but you should double check the fingerprint of github.com.</p>
<pre><code> $ ssh git@github.com
The authenticity of host &#39;github.com (192.30.253.112)&#39; can&#39;t be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added &#39;github.com,192.30.253.112&#39; (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
Hi linluk! You&#39;ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.</code></pre>
<p>If you see the line <em>Hi USERNAME! You’ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.</em> everything is fine and you are able to authenticate via your ssh key.</p>
<p>You can <code>git clone</code> a repository with a ssh link. You will find a repositories ssh link either via the web interface (click <em>Clone or Download</em> and than <em>Use SSH</em>) or simply build it yourself. GitHub ssh links are in the format <code>git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git</code>. For example with the command:</p>
<pre><code> $ git clone git@github.com:linluk/my-dot-files.git</code></pre>
<p>You can also update the remote url of an existing repository to its ssh link using this <code>git remote set-url</code>. For example with the command:</p>
<pre><code> $ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:linluk/my-dot-files.git</code></pre>
<p>When pushing git will prompt for your passphrase and authenticate with your GitHub account using ssh.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Just few minutes of work and we have set up an ssh key to authenticate on GitHub. This allows us to have a strong password for your account which you don’t need to remember. (If you use a password manager, what you definitely should!) But still can use an easy to remember passphrase when pushing via command line.</p>

<em>Have fun</em> :-)

<p><strong>2018-06-14 Edit:</strong> I just set up a fresh ubuntu system and restored my <code>~/.ssh</code> directory. But it didn’t worked for me, after one minute googeeling I found out, that the <code>~/.ssh</code> directory should have <code>700</code> rights and the containing files should have <code>600</code> rights. after fixing that (via a simple <code>chmod</code> everything worked as expected.</p>
